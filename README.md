DO NOT FORK THIS YET, REUPLOADING RHODUM'S FILES AREN'T FINISHED SINCE GITHUB DOESN'T ALLOW ALOT OF FILES UPLOADED

# Rhodum
This repository is the official Rhodum source code. DO NOT USE THIS SOURCE ON YOUR OWN PROJECT, USE <a href="https://github.com/Epiculy" target="_blank">EPICULY</a>'s PERMISSION FIRST.

# Why was this leaked?
Because Epiculy cannot run a revival. Rhodum contains a rat, and alot of 10 year olds actually trusted this. Reminder that this uses the Graphictoria source, and like i said, DO NOT use it on your shitty ROBLOX revival, or it will be taken down with Epiculy's permission.

This is also the latest Rhodum source code. We have not leaked the database as it is <b>private</b>. But you can view the snagged version of the database, <a href="https://github.com/qunjz/Rhodum/blob/main/rhod688055_rhodum.sql">here</a>, which means you cannot view user info such as useragents and other info. Credit to Table for the database, and Scott for cleaning it.

# Credits
Credit to Epiculy for scamming someone, and getting the site beamed, and big thanks to Table for leaking the source, along with Scott for getting and ridding the database of IPs and other stuff, I have the database aswell (because Scott accidentally sent it in a gc lol)

# NOTE
DO NOT USE THIS INFORMATION IN ANY HARMFUL WAY. THIS INFO IS ONLY FOR INSIGHT PURPOSES. NO DISTRIBUTING HASHED PASSWORDS, USERAGENTS, ECT.  ~ Scott
