# Rhodum
This repository is the official Rhodum source code. DO NOT USE THIS SOURCE ON YOUR OWN PROJECT, USE <a href="https://github.com/Epiculy" target="_blank">EPICULY</a>'s PERMISSION FIRST.

# Why was this leaked?
Because Epiculy cannot run a revival. Rhodum contains a rat, and alot of 10 year olds actually trusted this. Reminder that this uses the Graphictoria source, and like i said, DO NOT use it on your shitty ROBLOX revival, or it will be taken down with Epiculy's permission.

This is also the latest Rhodum source code. We have not leaked the database as it is <b>private</b>.
